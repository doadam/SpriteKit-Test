=============

This is a demonstration of the relatively new SpriteKit introduced by Apple at WWDC 2013. This code is probably not the best way to implement this as I'm not that expert in Objective-C (nor trying to learn it), but just to make a fun game about Musalila. If you want to make an Android branch (other than using Apportable to import the game for Android) let me know.
